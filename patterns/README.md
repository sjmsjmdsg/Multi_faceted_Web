# Pattern Sets

We conclude 93 pattern sets, with 31 pattern sets for vulnerability type, root cause and impact respectively.
Each pattern set represent a thesaurus set containing several patterns for aspect filtering.
Each pattern set contains one include pattern set and one exclude pattern set.
Include pattern set records the pattern vulnerability should involve, while exclude pattern set records the pattern vulnerabilities MUST not have.
All the patterns are recorded in the special_marks.py
